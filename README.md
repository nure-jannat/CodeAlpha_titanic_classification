# TITANIC CLASSIFICATION
Titanic dataset is one of the most popular dataset in the field of Machine Learning and Data Science. The dataset has passenger information who boarded the Titanic along with other information like survival status, success-socio-economic status, age, gender and more. 

I have made a model on this legendary dataset as a part of my internship program for Data Science at CodeAlpha. My code cover the following area -
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Data Visualization
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Feature Encoding
5. Model Building 
6. Model Evaluation

I used the Logistic Regression for building the model. The accuracy for this model is 81%. 

Initially data are in two files "train.csv" and "test.csv". I make a model on the "train.csv" an.d evaluated it. After that I again do some preprocessing on the "test.csv" to feed them in my model, then I predict the survival status.
